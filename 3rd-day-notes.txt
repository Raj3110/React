->BIG MISTAKE TO AVOID.

the package-lock.json SHOULD NOT be added to .gitignore. -> (cause while downloading npm it didnt came it came with parcel package.. seprately so always include package-lock.json in github or u might face issues)
 Instead, I strongly advise:

Add the package-lock.json you to your version control repository
Use "npm ci" instead of "npm install" when building your application both locally and in your deployment pipeline.


-> package.json
The package.json file is the heart of Node.js system. 
It is the manifest file of any Node.js project and contains the metadata of the project.

-> package-lock.json - locks version
package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either 
the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, 
such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate 
dependency updates.

->these files came up with command to initialize install parcel

npm install -D parcel
// dev dependency
"devDependencies": {
        "parcel": "^2.9.3"
}

npm install parcel
// global dependency


-> ~ (tilde) , ^ (carrat)

(~,^) - automatically will update version 

"parcel": "2.9.3"   <- i want this as fix package (no updates)
"parcel": "^2.9.3"   <- i want to small version updates if available (ex - 2.9.4) 
"parcel": "~2.9.3"  <- if i want big version updates (ex - 3.9.0)
